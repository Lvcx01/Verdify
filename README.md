# Verdify 🌿

**Verdify** is a mobile application developed as a university project for the **Software Engineering** course. 
It is an AI-powered assistant designed to help users take better care of their plants by bridging the gap between botanical knowledge and modern technology.

## 📌 Project Overview
The main goal of this project was to build a functional prototype in **Kotlin** that solves real-world gardening challenges. By combining image processing and external APIs, Verdify provides users with data-driven advice to keep their plants healthy and thriving.

## ✨ Key Features
